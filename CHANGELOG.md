## [0.8.2] — 2026-04-21 (Hardening — 10-Agent Review Pass)

Full-codebase review by 10 parallel sub-agents (hooks, media scripts, utility scripts, agents, skills, commands, rules, templates, docs, plugin+privacy) produced 11 blockers and ~40 should-fix items. All blockers and most should-fix items resolved in a single release.

### Fixed — Blockers
- `safety-gate.sh` no longer blocks git on scanner-internal errors (trap ERR → exit 0); COMMAND extraction now uses robust Python JSON parsing instead of fragile grep on quoted strings
- `commit-format.sh` regex extraction rewritten via heredoc — previous broken quote-escapes meant the hook effectively never rejected bad messages
- `handoff-sync.py` no longer auto-stages `shared/handoff/` — respects the user's working-tree state
- `_media_lib.py` `load_keys()` no longer dumps the entire shell env; parses media-keys.sh directly via regex, returns only the 2 allow-listed keys
- MagicHour scripts (faceswap/headswap/upscale/video) now detect local-path vs HTTPS-URL inputs; local paths fail cleanly with guidance (MagicHour requires hosted URLs)
- `screenshot.py` PowerShell command injection closed — Windows path passed via `CWE_OUT` env var, never interpolated into PS script text
- `commands/help.md` + `commands/plugins.md` no longer hardcode version/command counts — dynamic lookup from plugin.json + `ls commands/*.md`
- `templates/statusline.py` docstring aligned with reality (no currency/cost feature yet); `/cwe:init` currency prompt removed
- 13 template placeholders (`{{INSTALL_COMMAND}}` etc.) converted to natural-language hints; 4 auto-filled placeholders (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{project-name}}`, `{{project-slug}}`, `{{DATE}}`) explicitly documented in `/cwe:init`
- `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` + `CLAUDE.md` bumped from stale v0.7.0 → v0.8.2; command/skill counts corrected (25 cmds / 17 skills); Media Tools + External Services + Multi-Terminal sections added to USER-GUIDE

### Changed — Should-fix
- 5 media skills use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` instead of undocumented `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`
- 11 prose skills declare `allowed-tools` (least privilege); `bookstack` and `git-standards` descriptions demoted from PROACTIVELY (they're invoked by commands/hooks, not free-text)
- Keyword→agent tables deduplicated: auto-delegation is canonical; agent-detection and delegator reference it
- Agents: `quality` permission `default`→`plan` (was inconsistent with READ-ONLY rule); `innovator` `default`→`acceptEdits`; `researcher` gains Write/Edit for docs flows; `quality` tools broadened beyond Node (pytest, cargo, go, ruff, mypy, golangci-lint); 4 conversational agents `maxTurns: 30→40`
- All 10 agents: `@workflow/product/mission.md` frontmatter include removed (file absent in fresh installs); replaced by Read-tool guidance in Context section
- `/cwe:init`: SearXNG default port `:8080` → `:4000` (was colliding with Stirling PDF); Gitea/BookStack split into separate setup steps
- `commands/gitea.md`: `username:` → `user:` key (consistent with init.md template); `~/.claude/cwe.local.md` → `$HOME/.claude/cwe.local.md`
- `commands/autopilot.md`: explicit `CYCLE/MAX_CYCLES` counter pattern (was claimed but missing)
- `commands/qa-merge.md`: replaced broken `git merge origin/t1-*` glob with enumerated loop; same for worktree removal
- `commands/check-handoff.md`: dirty-tree guard added before `git checkout -- shared/handoff/`
- `commands/devops.md`: VERSION-file guard at top of release flow
- `commands/transcript.md` + `commands/pdf.md`: Python-based YAML parsing for `cwe-settings.yml` (was brittle grep|sed)
- `.claude/rules/_index.yml` synced with each file's frontmatter `paths:`; `frontend-standards.md` paths broadened to include Svelte/Astro/Angular; `database-standards.md` migration-naming rule generalised beyond one tool; `testing-standards.md` gains "Testing Stacks" section (Vitest/Playwright/pytest/hypothesis/contract)
- `documentation-standards.md` — verified frontmatter present (previously believed missing)
- PII rule canonicalised in `global-standards.md`; api/database/testing point there

### Security
- Last stray private hostnames in `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` example yaml replaced with `localhost:*` defaults

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-21 (PDF + Screenshot-Flip + Init Extensions + Docs)

### Added
- `/cwe:pdf`: Read PDFs by converting pages to images via configurable Stirling PDF API (requires user-provided URL in `.claude/cwe-settings.yml`)
- `/cwe:screenshot`: Flipped from Bash-inline to `scripts/screenshot.py` — detects WSL2/macOS/Wayland/X11, reads clipboard, returns JSON (59 → 35 lines Markdown, deterministic logic in Python)

### Changed
- `/cwe:init` expanded with 5 new optional setup steps: Transcript (TScribe URL), Stirling PDF, Media Keys (OpenRouter + MagicHour), Remotion project dir, Gitea/BookStack
- `/cwe:init` now detects existing `~/.claude/statusline.py` and does not overwrite it
- `templates/statusline.py`: Compact one-line format (ctx | usage | time)
- Hook scripts (`commit-format.sh`, `transcript.sh`) auto-detect `python3` or `python` via `$(command -v python3 || command -v python)` — fixes environments where only one binary exists
- README: Updated badges to show 17 skills, 25 commands, version 0.8.1; added Media Generation section to command tables
- SVG header: Updated version label from v0.6.2 to v0.8.1
- CHANGELOG, ARCHITECTURE, USER-GUIDE: All yt-transcript references renamed to transcript

### Security
- Private research commands (doj-scrape, doj-search, newsroom) added to `.gitignore` — they stay local only

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-21 (Media Tools + Content Tools)

### Added — Media Generation
- `scripts/_media_lib.py`: Shared helpers (JSON output, API-key loading, OpenRouter + MagicHour HTTP, job polling, downloads)
- `/cwe:image`: Text-to-Image + Image-Editing via Gemini on OpenRouter (scripts/gemini_image.py)
- `/cwe:faceswap`: Face Swap for photos and videos (scripts/magichour_faceswap.py)
- `/cwe:headswap`: Head Swap for photos (scripts/magichour_headswap.py)
- `/cwe:upscale`: Image Upscaler 2x/4x (scripts/magichour_upscale.py)
- `/cwe:video`: Text/Image-to-Video (scripts/magichour_video.py)
- `/cwe:motion`: React-based Motion Graphics via Remotion (skills/motion/SKILL.md — reads remotion_project_dir from settings)
- API keys live in `scripts/media-keys.sh` (gitignored); `/cwe:init` configures them

### Added — Content Tools
- `/cwe:transcript` (renamed from `/cwe:yt-transcript`): Audio/Video transcription for YouTube + any URL via user-configured TScribe (faster-whisper) server. tubetranscript remains as YouTube fallback when TScribe is unreachable.
- `intent-router.py`: Now also routes Instagram/TikTok URLs to `/cwe:transcript`; added routing for `pdf`, `image`, `video`, `upscale`, `faceswap`, `headswap` commands

### Changed
- Renamed `hooks/scripts/yt-transcript.sh` → `hooks/scripts/transcript.sh`
- Removed all hardcoded private infrastructure — all external services (Stirling PDF, TScribe, SearXNG, Firecrawl, Remotion) now read from `.claude/cwe-settings.yml` with graceful fallbacks

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-20 (Multi-OS Portability + Stability)

### Fixed
- **macOS compatibility**: All hooks (`branch-naming.sh`, `safety-gate.sh`, `subagent-start.sh`, `subagent-stop.sh`) replaced `grep -oP` (GNU PCRE) with `grep -oE` (POSIX extended regex) — fixes silent breakage on macOS BSD grep
- `session-start.sh`: Version no longer hardcoded, reads from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `handoff-sync.py`: `git fetch` throttled to 60s intervals (was firing on every prompt); output now uses `systemMessage` for consistency with other hooks

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-11 (Multi-Terminal + Feature Alignment)

### Added — Multi-Terminal Parallel Development (Paket 4)
- `/cwe:autopilot` command: Autonomous task loop — sync, find TODOs, execute, commit, push
- `/cwe:coordinate` command: Team-lead coordination — fetch, review commits, dispatch handoffs
- `/cwe:check-handoff` command: Read and summarize pending handoff entries
- `/cwe:handoff` command: Write structured handoff entries, commit + push
- `/cwe:qa-merge` command: QA-verified merge of terminal branches to main
- `skills/multi-terminal/SKILL.md`: Multi-Terminal reference (handoff protocol, entry format, presets)
- `templates/multi-terminal/`: Terminal prompt templates, handoff file templates, README
- `hooks/scripts/handoff-sync.py`: Entry-count sync from other terminal branches (UserPromptSubmit)
- `hooks/scripts/mt-session-init.py`: Worktree detection + handoff context injection (SessionStart)
- Multi-Terminal setup integrated into `/cwe:init` (Presets: 2T, 3T, 4T, Custom)
- Branch-detection guard: MT hooks silently skip when not in `t\d+-` worktree

### Added — Hook Events Modernization (Paket 1)
- `SessionEnd` event: `session-stop.sh` now fires on actual session end (not every turn)
- `SubagentStart` event: `subagent-start.sh` logs agent start to daily log
- `hooks/scripts/subagent-start.sh`: New hook script for agent start observability

### Changed — Hook Events (Paket 1)
- `session-stop.sh` moved from `Stop` → `SessionEnd` (fires once at session end, not every turn)
- `Stop` event now only contains `idea-flush.sh` (needs per-turn checking)

### Changed — Agent Memory Scopes (Paket 2)
- `guide` agent: `memory: project` → `memory: user` (workflow patterns are cross-project)
- `innovator` agent: `memory: project` → `memory: user` (creative ideas are cross-project)
- `security` agent: `memory: project` → `memory: user` (security patterns apply everywhere)

### Added — Agent Frontmatter (Paket 3)
- All 10 agents now have `permissionMode` and `maxTurns` frontmatter fields
- READ-ONLY agents (ask, explainer, guide, security, researcher, architect): `permissionMode: plan`
- Edit agents (builder, devops): `permissionMode: acceptEdits`
- Mixed agents (quality, innovator): `permissionMode: default`
- Turn limits: 30 (ask, explainer, guide, innovator), 40 (security, researcher, architect, quality), 50 (builder, devops)

---

## [0.6.2] — 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- `yt-transcript.sh` CRLF line endings causing "hook error" on every prompt (converted to LF)
- Intent-router: Added missing `debug` agent (was completely absent)
- Intent-router: German verb conjugations now match (`implementiere`, `erkläre`, `debugge`, etc.)
- Intent-router: Umlaut alternatives (`ä`/`ae`, `ü`/`ue`) for non-UTF8 input
- Intent-router: Removed `code` false positive from builder (triggered on "erkläre den Code")
- Keyword coverage expanded from 13/35 → 41/41 test cases passing
- `session-stop.sh`: Removed misleading "Session complete" message (fires every turn, not just session end)
- `idea-flush.sh`: Only notifies when unreviewed idea count changes (no more repeated messages every turn)
- `docs/plans/` removed from repo (session-specific, added to `.gitignore`)

### Added
- `/cwe:gitea` command: Privater Git-Mirror auf Gitea — push, ssh-push, list, create, delete, clone, status (config via `~/.claude/cwe.local.md`)
- `/cwe:gitea ssh-push`: SSH-basierter Push für große Repos und Git LFS

### Changed
- SVG header redesigned in terminal/ASCII-art style (Catppuccin Mocha palette)
- `docs/plans/` removed from repo and added to `.gitignore` (session-specific, not plugin code)

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- `hooks/scripts/url-scraper.py`: Auto-scrapes non-YouTube URLs in user prompts (Firecrawl → trafilatura → curl fallback)
- Intent-router: Utility command routing for `yt-transcript`, `screenshot`, `web-research`
- Intent-router: Generic URLs suppressed via `hook_handled` flag (no false routing to builder/researcher)
- `/cwe:init` Step 1f: SearXNG/Firecrawl configuration with connectivity test

### Changed
- Hook chain order: intent-router → **url-scraper** → idea-observer → yt-transcript
- `commands/yt-transcript.md`: Deduplicated — now calls existing hook script instead of inline Python
- `commands/web-research.md`: All scraping outputs now JSON-formatted for machine consumption
- `commands/screenshot.md`: Added cleanup step (removes temp PNG after analysis)
- `commands/yt-transcript.md`, `screenshot.md`, `web-research.md`: Descriptions updated to "MUSS VERWENDET WERDEN" pattern

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-23 (Hybrid Delegation Release)

### Changed
- Version bump 0.5.4 → 0.6.0 across all files (plugin.json, CLAUDE.md, README, help.md, session-start.sh, USER-GUIDE, header SVG)
- Agent routing now hook-driven (systemMessage) instead of prose-based (CLAUDE.md tables)
- Fallback chain: intent-router hook → agent descriptions → auto-delegation skill
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Added Intent Router Hook section with fallback chain documentation

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-02-23

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md radically reduced** from 98 to ~8 lines — behavioral corrections only, routing moved to hook
- All 10 command descriptions sharpened with "MUSS VERWENDET WERDEN für..." pattern (German imperative)

### Removed
- Routing tables, Decision Flow, Quick Reference, Idea Capture docs from CLAUDE.md (moved to hook + skills)

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- `hooks/scripts/intent-router.py`: UserPromptSubmit hook for automatic agent routing
- Keyword-based intent detection routes prompts to correct CWE agent via systemMessage
- Multi-agent detection (2+ agents matched) triggers delegator skill for compound requests
- Registered intent-router as first hook in UserPromptSubmit chain (before idea-observer)

---

## [0.5.2] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- `commands/yt-transcript.md`: YouTube transcript extraction command (no API key required)
- `hooks/scripts/yt-transcript.sh`: UserPromptSubmit hook auto-detects YouTube URLs
- Pure Python 3 stdlib implementation — no API keys, no dependencies

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- `skills/delegator/SKILL.md`: Multi-agent request coordination — decomposes multi-step requests into sub-tasks with dependency ordering and wave-based parallel dispatch
- `hooks/scripts/_lib.sh`: Shared helper library for all hook scripts (`json_escape`, `json_msg`, `grep_count`, `line_count`, `resolve_root`, `resolve_slug`)
- `templates/statusline.py`: Statusline template for automatic installation during `/cwe:init`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Plugin architecture documentation (plugin structure, agent system, hook flow, skill system, memory)
- `commands/init.md`: Step 1e — automatic statusline installation after currency config

### Fixed
- **All hook scripts**: Hardened JSON output via shared `_lib.sh` — prevents newlines, unescaped quotes, backslashes, and tabs from breaking JSON
- `hooks/scripts/idea-flush.sh:24`: **Root cause of "JSON validation failed"** — `grep -c || echo 0` produced `0\n0` (newline in JSON) when no raw ideas existed; now uses `grep_count` wrapper
- `hooks/scripts/idea-observer.sh`: Escape order bug (backslashes before quotes) + now uses `json_escape` for all user input
- `hooks/scripts/session-start.sh`: Replaced custom `json_escape_stdin` with shared `json_escape`; bumped version to v0.5.1

- `commands/plugins.md`: Fixed misleading "14/16 loaded" example to show success case
- 8 agents: Removed dead `@workflow/product/architecture.md` and `@workflow/product/roadmap.md` references (files never created by init)

### Changed
- Version bump 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 across all files (plugin.json, CLAUDE.md, README.md, help.md, USER-GUIDE.md, session-start.sh)
- `README.md`: Added explanation for `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, mentioned statusline setup in Quick Start
- `.gitignore`: Hardened — protects private data (cwe-settings.yml, agent-memory, *.local.md/json/yml, credentials, keys, IDE settings)
- `.claude/cwe-settings.yml`: Removed from tracking (user-local preference, created by `/cwe:init`)
- `skills/web-research/SKILL.md` + `commands/web-research.md`: Replaced hardcoded private server URLs with configurable `${SEARXNG_URL}` / `${FIRECRAWL_URL}` environment variables; URLs now set per-project in `.claude/cwe-settings.yml`
- Git history: Scrubbed all traces of private infrastructure addresses via `git-filter-repo`

- **Currency configuration**: `/cwe:init` now asks for preferred currency (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF) — stored in `.claude/cwe-settings.yml`
- **Project settings file**: `.claude/cwe-settings.yml` — per-project configuration (first setting: currency)
- **Statusline features**: color-coded context bar (green/yellow/red), token count, cost conversion, session duration, lines added/removed, project directory name

### Changed
- `commands/init.md`: Added Step 1d (currency selection) to initialization flow
- `hooks/hooks.json`: PreCompact hook changed from prompt-type to command-type (`session-stop.sh`) — eliminates "JSON validation failed" errors
- `.claude/rules/documentation-standards.md`: Softened wording — documentation updates now conditional on `memory/` directory existence
- Version bump: 0.4.4 → 0.5.0 across all files

### Removed
- Stop hook prompt: Removed the "Session is ending, update documentation" prompt hook that caused errors on every session end
- `docs/plans/`: Deleted obsolete design documents (memory-mcp server design, phase 2 plan, memory-system-v2 design)

### Fixed
- Stop hook "JSON validation failed" error: caused by aggressive prompt hook enforcing documentation updates
- Statusline showing `Context: --` instead of actual usage: replaced bash/jq script with Python for broader compatibility

---

- Stop hook prompt: shortened and made more resilient for short sessions
- `session-start.sh`: Agent delegation list now includes ask and guide agents
- `subagent-stop.sh`: Fixed logic error — no longer tries to write daily log when memory/ doesn't exist
- `commands/init.md`: Fixed domain count from 7 to 8 (documentation was missing)
- `commands/help.md`: Replaced Memory MCP Server reference with Serena memory

### Changed
- Version bump: 0.4.3 → 0.4.4 across all files (plugin.json, CLAUDE.md, help.md, session-start.sh, README, USER-GUIDE)
